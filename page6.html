            In this game, you are given two options, <span class="highlight">big</span> and <span class="highlight">small</span>, and you have to choose one. 
            You make this choice based on logic. Once chosen, you can place money on your selected option.
        </p>
        <p>
            After putting money, if the sum of two numbers is less than 10, it will be called <span class="highlight">small</span>, 
            and if the sum is 10 or more, it will be called <span class="highlight">big</span>. If your chosen option matches the result, 
            you <span class="highlight">win</span>, and if not, you <span class="highlight">lose</span>. 
            If you win, you get <span class="highlight">1.95X</span> of the amount you bet, and if you lose, your bet is deducted.
